    <h1>The Magestic Leopard Gecko</h1>
    <h2>A Popular Import</h2>
    <p> Although the leopard gecko is native to dry and semi-desert areas in Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran,
        and northwest India, these hardy little reptiles have been kept and bred as pets for more than 30 years. They
        are one of the most commonly kept lizards today. Their docile nature and relative ease of care make them popular
        for home terrariums, as long as their habitat is representative of their native homes.

    <h2>Easy to Spot</h2>
    <p>
        The name “leopard gecko” is very appropriate, as the body color is often yellow with irregular
        black spots, but these charming little reptiles can be found in a variety of colors, patterns, and sizes. Most
        captive leopard geckos retain the color pattern of their wild counterparts: the dorsal body is light to dark
        yellow with numerous black markings, the ventral body is white, and the tail is banded. However, several
        different color combinations have been produced through selective breeding programs.

        The tail is segmented; if part of the tail is lost, it can regenerate, but may not look the same. Juveniles have
        bands across their bodies. The toes end in a small claw. Because of their moveable eyelids, these animals can
        close their eyes—and their long tongue can give those eyes a quick lick as needed. The underside of the body is
        white. In gravid females, the eggs can clearly be seen through the skin. Males are easily recognized by their
        preanal pores.
